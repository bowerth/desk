## Summary

  - combine data from National Accounts with Structural Business
    Statistics
  - extend main source with one or more secondary sources
  - add distribution from more detailed source
  - hierarchical benchmarking to main source

A short tutorial can be found at the end of this helpfile


## Interface Controls

### Tables

__Data__ Pivoted table of values for selected combination of country,
variable and industry dimensions by source with years in columns.

__Calculation__ If more than one variable or industry is selected, the
ratio between the two variables or industries is calculated by
default. Alternatively, the difference can be calculated.

### DataTables

__Sources__ Selected sources for estimation as stored in array
`stani3Estimate.rda`.

__Hierarchy__ Hierarchy of industry lists

### Plots

__Lines__ Line plot: multiple sources, one industry

__Bars__ Bar plot: one source, multiple industries


## Data

### Dimensions

__Country__ 3-digit ISO code

__Variable__ STAN variable code

__Industry__ STAN ISIC Rev. 4 industry code(s)

### Units

__Monetary variables__ million US Dollars

__EMP__ persons

### Sources

__NSONAPATCH__ Data collected and harmonised from National Accounts published by National Statistical Offices not included in STAN

__STANandBTD__ Variables from National Accounts by detailed industry
in ISIC Rev. 3 (latest year: 2009) (`IMPO` and `EXPO` from __Bilateral
Trade Database ISIC Rev. 3 (BTD)__)

__STANandBTDi4__ Variables from National Accounts by detailed industry
in ISIC Rev. 4, roughly converted to ISIC Rev. 3 (see ISIC 4 to ISIC 3 conversion table below, `IMPO` and `EXPO` from __Bilateral
Trade Database ISIC Rev. 4 (BTD)__)

### Edits

__Min and max year__ Data points to be removed from sources (by country and variable) can be specified in the init file `stani3Estimate_drop.csv`


## Estimation

### Preview

The preview is limited in a way that it only allows to perform
estimations for one industry at a time. Therefore, the results in the
preview are not adjusted. Source information is read from and save in
the array `stani3Estimate_srcarray.rda`.

__Extend__ Extend main source with growth rates from secondary source

__Detail__ Apply distribution from secondary source to main source, preserving
existing detail in the main source

### Export

By default, the export function performs *Extend* and *Detail*
estimation for __all industries__ and adjusts the results. Depending on
the number of secondary sources for each combination of dimensions,
the procedure can take considerable time to finish (one minute per
country).

__Export countries__ Select the regions or countries to include in results

__Export variables__ Select variables to include in results

__Update results__ Check to run estimations and save updated results to
disk. Henceforth, latest results can be exported from object without
re-running the estimation procedure.

__Export flat file (csv)__ create long form table including results for all
available combinations selected for export

__Export Excel file(s)__ create Excel file for each selected country
with one sheet per variable

__Include calculations__ perform calculations with exported
variables. Currently defined are:

  - `VALUshPROD` = `VALU / PROD * 100`
  - `LABRshVALU` = `LABR / VALU * 100`
  - `VALUperEMPN` = `VALU / EMPN * 10^6`
  - `VALUshCTOTAL` = `VALU / VALU_CTOTAL * 100`

## Tutorial

Select country

![](figures/stani3Estimate_cou.png)

Activate the two fields "Extend series" and "Applied detailed industry share"
the currently defined combination of sources will be inserted

![](figures/stani3Estimate_estimation.png)

click "Download XLS" to produce estimates

![](figures/stani3Estimate_download.png)

  - results for additional countries can be produced by selecting them
in the export section
  - this can take a while depending on the number of selected countries
  - when ready, a zip folder with all results will be downloaded

![](figures/stani3Estimate_exportcou.png)

the vector of countries for exporting can be seen in the "Plots" tab
below the plot
